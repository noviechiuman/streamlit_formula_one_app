# Formula 1 2022 Streamlit App

Hey, folks! ðŸ‘‹

This repository contains a Python Streamlit app to view the current Formula 1 2022 statistics such as driver standing, constructor standing, grand prix results, as well as locations of the 2022 circuits.
I've also included a Jupyter notebook for data scraping (source: www.racing-statistics.com ).

Check out the two Streamlit apps which I used as references for my Streamlit app:
